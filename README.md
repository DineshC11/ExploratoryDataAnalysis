# ExploratoryDataAnalysis

This project helps the developer to perform operations on CSV file extenstions. It summarizes the whole CSV file contents into group of Strings and Integers.
Likewise it consolidates the operations for Integers like (Min, Max and Mean) and String operations like (UniqueValues, RepeatedValues, CaseType and Abbreviation Count).
Finally produce the output into an new CSV file.
